# Predicting Breast Cancer Using Particle Swarm Optimization
# Project Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer using a machine learning approach optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using PSO to optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen machine learning model.

Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
PSOlib (a library for Particle Swarm Optimization)
Matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Additionally, the project is available on Google Colab, which provides an environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed. You can access the project using the following link:

Colab Notebook

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Usage
To run the project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

Open the Colab Notebook.
Click on "Open in Colab".
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
For running the project locally, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd predicting-breast-cancer-using-pso
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Code Structure
The project is organized into the following modules:

data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
model_training.py: Includes the machine learning model and the training process.
pso_optimization.py: Implements Particle Swarm Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.
main.py: The main script that ties all modules together and executes the workflow.
Model Training and Optimization
The model training involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and scaled.
Model Definition: A machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) is defined.
PSO Optimization: PSO is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.
Model Evaluation: The optimized model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Results
The results of the model, including the performance metrics and the optimal hyperparameters found using PSO, are displayed at the end of the notebook/script.
